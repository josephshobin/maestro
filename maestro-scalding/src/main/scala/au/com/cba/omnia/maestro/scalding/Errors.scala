   * This is totally unacceptable but is the only mechanism by which we have
   * been able to construct error handling for validation on sources that can
   * be written to file and doesn't involve doing multiple passes on the
   * source data.
   *
   * It is also _dangerous_ in that you can not add multiple traps. If you
   * do, you will receive a _runtime_ error (please do not swallow this,
   * fix your program so it only has one trap).
   *
   * The process is basically that we give up on types and hack away:
   *   - Go into untyped land by stripping off the "left" data constructor (this
   *     means we end up with a TypedPipe[Any]) that will either have raw failure
   *     strings, or success in a "right" data constructor. We do this so errors
   *     are written out raw, without the \/-() constructor.
   *   - Make the conversion strict via a call to fork.
   *   - Add a trap on the regular pipe, for routing all failures to an error source.
   *   - Force errors into error pipe, by:
   *     - Doing a runtime match on rights, and returning the raw value.
   *     - For all other cases (i.e. our errors), throw an exception to trigger
   *       the trap. The trap writes out the value in the pipe, not the exception,
   *       but should neatly write out the error because of our previous hack to
   *       strip off the left constructor.
